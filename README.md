# Ball-gravcontrol

A Unity 2020.1 game where the player has the ability to control gravity for a series of spheres on a course.

Input is done through keyboard or a controller (the controller input works a little bit better, controling gravity that way "feels" better).

This project is MIT licensed in order to be expanded and used in a future commercial project.
